That's it. All that happened during the month of October in the Pakistani Game Development scene mostly related to PC indie games. Hopefully, I'll be able to do this again next month. 

Did I miss something? Do you know of a Pakistani indie studio or developers that are doing something cool? Please share and help me highlight them.

Are you a developer or part of a studio? Please feel free to post about your own work.
