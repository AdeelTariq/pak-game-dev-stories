That's it. All that happened during the month of November in the Pakistani Game Development scene mostly related to PC indie games.

Did I miss something? Do you know of a Pakistani indie studio or developers that are doing something cool? Please share and help me highlight them.

Are you a developer or part of a studio? Please feel free to post about your own work.
